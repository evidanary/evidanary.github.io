I am a Software Developer. I have been since 2006. I'm passionate about building products. I am also a [husband](https://www.twitter.com/tejal29), a father of [two](https://www.twitter.com/sparkylovesmom) [boys](https://twitter.com/sparkylovesmom/status/871815205294145536), a [blogger](https://medium.com/@evidanary), an electronic music fan, and a bunch of other things too.

I'm the creator of [GrepPage](https://www.greppage.com). Previously, I was data engineer at Lookout Mobile Security. I have a Masters from Carnegie Mellon University in Information Systems and Bachelors in Computer Science from University of Texas - Dallas.
