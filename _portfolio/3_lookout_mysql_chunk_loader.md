Wrote MySQL to Hadoop loader (similar to SQOOP) for firewall heavy infrastructures at [Lookout Mobile Security](https://www.lookout.com)

- Wrote and tuned a MySQL DB loader that loaded data in Hadoop by breaking the database in to chunks
- Added ability to repeat-fetch on errors and load a single chunk at a time
